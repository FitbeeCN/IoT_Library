To build you'll need to make sure you run `make arduino` first in the main telehash-c directory (to copy in the required source files to where the Arduino IDE wants them) and have this telehash-c/arduino directory linked/copied in your main Arduino libraries location.

You can then build the Test.ino with the IDE or edit the Makefile and run run `make` in this directory.
