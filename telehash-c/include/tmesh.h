tempo_t is a synchronized comm thread
every tempo has a medium id that identifies the transceiver details
all tempos belong to a mote->community for grouping
two types of tempos: signals and streams
motes have one constant signal tempo and on-demand stream tempos
signal tempo
  - use shared secrets across the community
  - can be lost signal, derived secret and no neighbors
  - signal tempo should use limited medium to ease syncing
  - include neighbor info and stream requests
  - either side initiates stream tempo
  - 6*10-block format, +4 mmh
    - neighbors (+rssi)
    - stream req (+repeat)
    - signals (+hops)
stream tempo
  - use one-time secrets
  - initiated from signals
  - frames only
  - flush meta space for app use
  - inside channel sent link signal sync

mediums
  - limit # of channels
  - set rx tolerance
  - indicate power/lna for rssi comparisons
  - tm->tempo(tempo), sets window min/max, can change secret

stream tempos are lost until first rx
lost streams are reset each signal
lost signal hash is 8+50+4 w/ hash of just 50, rx can detect difference
!signal->lost after first good rx
must be commanded to change tx signal->lost, scheduled along w/ medium change

stream hold/lost/idle states
  * hold means don't schedule
  * idle means don't signal, dont schedule TX but do schedule RX (if !hold)
  * lost means signal (if !idle), hold = request, !hold || mote->signal->lost = accept
    - TX/RX signal accept is stream resync event
  - idle is cleared on any new send data, set after any TX/RX if !ready && !await
  - mote_gone() called by the driver based on missed RX, sets lost if !idle, hold if idle

TODO, move flags to explicit vs implicit:
  * do_schedule and !do_schedule
    - skip TX if !ready && !awaiting
    - set true on any new data
  * do_signal and !do_signal
    - do_schedule = true if mote->signal->lost
    - request if !do_schedule, else accept
  * mote_gone() called by the driver based on missed RX
    - sets do_schedule = false
    - sets do_signal = true if ready||awaiting

beacon > lost
  * tm->beacon alongside tm->signal
  * beacon is a stream, always starts w/ meta frame
    * meta contains sender nickname to ignore once linked (just for now, future is random id)
  * when no motes, beacon uses fast medium, if any other mote it goes slow
  * signal is off or slow when beaconing
  * only beacon open rx seeks
  * when mote looses signal it drops entirely, beacon goes fast
    * if stream request is not accepted in X signals, also drop
  * streams just go idle (not lost), low priori rx skip tx
  * after beacon stream exchanges handshake
    * start our signal to include in stream
    * create mote
    * move beacon to mote as stream
    * reset beacon after link is up
    * create their signal once received in stream meta
  * when routed packet is requested on a stream
    * cache from who on outgoing stream
    * include orig sender's full blocks in stream meta
    * faster way to establish signal to neighbor than waiting for slow beacon

... more notes
  * beacon (signal) advertises its shared stream
  * shared stream uses beacon id in secret to be unique
  * all tempo keys roll community name + other stuff + password

SECURITY TODOs
  * generate a temp hashname on boot, use that to do all beacon and shared stream handling

NEXT
  * use ad-hoc beacons for faster signal stream request/accept
